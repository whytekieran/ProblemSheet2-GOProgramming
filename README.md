# ProblemSheet2_GOProgramming

Solution to the Problem Sheet outline below. Written using GO and the Gorilla Web Toolkit. 

1. Create a git repository for the following problems. Make sure your repository has a readme ﬁle, a license ﬁle and a gitignore ﬁle. 

2. Setup your environment so that you can create a web application. It is recommended that you install a Go web application framework. 

3. Create a basic web application. Add a route to serve a resource which simply contains the text “Hello, world!”. Test your application so far. 

4. Add a static HTML page resource to your web application. Have it served as the root resource at /. Include any necessary CSS and JS ﬁles. 

5. Add a textbox and a label to the HTML page. Use JavaScript to have the reverse of the string in the text box output to the label. The label should update every time the user changes the text in the text box. 

6. Add a route using the GET method to the web server at /reverse. This route should accept a single variable, and it should respond with the variable’s value reversed as the resource. 

7. Change the JavaScript to use the server-side string reversal, instead of the client-side. 

8. Change the /reverse route to use the POST method instead,and update the JavaScript accordingly.
